**I'M GOING TO REPLICATE HOW PRINTF WORKS!! :)**

The printf() function is a C standard library function used to display data on the screen. It can output various data types, including hexadecimal, strings and pointers. printf() transfers data from memory to the screen and **returns** the count of characters written. A negative return value signifies an error.
