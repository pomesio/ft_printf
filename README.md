# ft_printf

**I AM GOING TO REPLICATE HOW PRINTF WORKS!! :)**

The printf function is a standard library function in C that allows you to write data to the standard output device (the screen). printf can write any combination of numeric values/characters/strings. Unlike the scanf function, which reads data from the keyboard, printf writes data from memory to the screen. The printf function returns the number of characters written. If it returns a negative value, it indicates that an error has occurred.
